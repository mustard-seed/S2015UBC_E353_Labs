LCD control:
            
lcd_on       1
lcd_blon     1     
lcd_rw       0
lcd_en       
lcd_rs    sending instr (0), sending char (1)

lcd_data: Data path, sampled on the FALLING EDGE of lcd_en.

sending the following once per reset:
00111000 (hex "38")
00111000 (hex "38")
00001100 (hex "0C")
00000001 (hex "01")
00000110 (hex "06")
10000000 (hex "80")

Aside: An exmple assigned hex value to std_logic_vector:
somevector =< "000" & h "0080"

FSM transists on rising edge

LCD transist on falling edge

Design:
- A FSM
- A COUNTER to count characters
- A CONVERTER to display character count
- LCD
- Internal Wirings


Pit Falls:
1. Cannot declare signals with the same names as the ones in components.
2. Cannot use hex"nn" to represent hex number, use x"nn" instead
3. In ModelSim assignment, the number of binary digits of the source signal must match the range of the in taking signal exaclty. For example, if we have
signal intake: std_logic_vector (9 downto 0)
then
std_logic_vector <= x"01" --will result in ModelSim run time error
std_logic_vector <= 00 & "01" --ok
