I. Data Path
  inputs: clock, reset, deal, dealTo, dealToCardSlot
  outputs: dealerStands, dealerWins, playerWins, dealerBust, playerBust, playerCards (record), dealerCards (record)
  Subcomponents:
  > DealCard x 8
  > ScoreHand x 2
  
  DealCard
  -- Samples a fast counting clock to generate pseudo-random number from 0 to 13. With a register to buffer output.
  
   inputs: enable, clock, reset
   outputs: countSample
  
  output changes synchornously and detect rise in enable signal between successive clock cycles
   
  ScoreHand
  -- Computer the total score of cards from a hand
  inputs: slots (array of unsigned)
  output: score

 Plan: 
  > Instantiate components in DataPath
  > 

II. Card7Seg
  input: Card (array of unsigned)
  output: display_signal (std_logic_vector)

Plan for May 28:
0.  Make top-level for DataPath. Instantiate lower level components. (Done)
1.  Make Card7Seg. Test on simulator, test on DE2.
    (Henry is working on it)

2.  Make DealCard. Test on simulator. Test on DE2 with Card7Seg. Use KEY0 and enable signal

3.  Make ScoreHand. Test on simulator

4.  Complete DataPath by adding additional logic. Test on simulator. Test on DE2.
